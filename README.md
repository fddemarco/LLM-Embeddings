# LLM-Embeddings

An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.
Embeddings are commonly used for:

* Search (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
* Clustering (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
* Recommendations (where items with related text strings are recommended)
* Anomaly detection (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
* Diversity measurement (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
* Classification (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)
